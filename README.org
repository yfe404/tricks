** Accessing every ports on a machine without external access (public IP) from internet.

*** Requirements :
    - a server with a public address (the gateway)
    - a machine without external access (the target)
    - a machine connected to the internet (the workstation that needs
      to access the target)
    - SSH must be installed on all the aforementioned machines
    - [[https://sshuttle.readthedocs.io][sshuttle]] must be installed on the workstation
    - Python must be installed on the target
    

*** Steps : 
    1. Create a reverse shell from target to gateway
       #+begin_src sh
       SRC_PORT=6776
       DST_PORT=22
       DST_USER=$USER
       DST_HOST=$GATEWAY_PUBLIC_IP

       autossh -M  0 -N -o ServerAliveInterval=15 -R $SRC_PORT:localhost:$DST_PORT $DST_USER@$DST_HOST
       #+end_src

    2. Forward port 8998 on the workstation to port 6776 on the
       gateway
       #+begin_src sh
       ssh -L 8998:localhost:6776 $USER@$GATEWAY_PUBLIC_IP
       #+end_src

    3. Use sshuttle to forward every port of the target on the
       workstation
       #+begin_src sh
       /usr/bin/sshttle --dns --remote $USER@localhost:8998 0.0.0.0/0
       #+end_src
